Jenny,

I thought I'd followup with some detail.

I've recently started a software company, to make software for energy trading. I have some
ideas on where to start. But you are much more knowledgeable on the gas side than I am, and
you have better contacts than I have. Basically, if I want to have a drink and get some ideas
from Joon, I don't think he'd respond to me, but I'll bet he would respond to you.

What you'd be doing potentially has a lot of value, and I'd be happy to compensate you for it.
To that end, I'm willing to offer you [some securities]. Basically, if things go well, you could
make up to an appreciably amount of money.

Longer term, frankly, I think you are excellent to work with, and would be a huge asset to any
organization. I can certainly see there being a spot for you in a senior position, should things
go well. If that creates an opportunity for you to leapfrog a few levels in your career, I am
more than happy to consider it. I certainly think you're capable.

tl;dr I'd like to pay you to get your thoughts on my business, and possibly pay you more if you're
interested in helping. 
Please let me kno
